# Caves & Lizards
> Text turn based ruby game

In dev.
Based on classic pen and paper games, mostly D&D

## Game
Not many things to do for now.
One encounter with 4 ennemies, for manual testing purposes.
You can only choose between 2 actions : attack an enemy or dodge. Miles away from an adventure and from a tale, but this is only the beginning!

## Run
You can clone the project and:
- `bundle install` to install gems
- `ruby run/launcher.rb` to play (more like, to test manually)
- `bundle exec rspec spec/FILENAME_spec.rb` to launch tests
