## Combat
A combat starts when enemies sees each others or when a part reveals itself to the other.

### Resolve initiative
All characters involved in combat roll initiative to determine turn order.
Roll initiative is the same as dexterity check (see Checks part).
Each character initiative is computed this way:
* roll **1d20**
* add **dexterity modifier** value
Each character takes its turn in the round starting with the bigger initiative value.

### Attack
First, you need to know if your attack touches. Then you will be able to determine damages done.
To attack, you need to:
* roll **1d20**
* add the correct **ability modifier** (by default, **strength** for melee or **dexterity** for ranged)
* add **proficiency** bonus

If you rolled a **20**, this is a **critical hit** that always touches.
If it's a **1**, this is a **critical fail** that never touches and can have bad consequences.

This score must be greater or equal to the **armor class (AC)** of the enemy:
* **base AC** of the armor it wears
* applied **dexterity bonus**

If it is the case, you can roll for **damage**

### Critical hit

### Critical fail

### Damage
If your attack touches, you can roll damage to know hom much hit points you striped off of your enemy.
* roll your weapon damage: if your weapon has a damage of **3d8**, you add the values of 3 dice of 8 faces
* add the **ability modifiers** you used in the attack

This gives you the total damages you have done to your opponent.

### Dodge
You can choose to dodge all attack made against you until your next turn.
Enemies attacking you will apply **disadvantage** meaning they will have to throw **2d20** and keep the smallest value in their attack roll.
